Hardware Used
Raspberry Pi 1.1.2: 

        Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers. With its low power consumption and small 
        form factor, the Raspberry Pi can be used in a wide variety of projects, from home automation and 
        media centers to robotics and industrial automation. It can be programmed using Python language and
         utilized to capture facial features and detect drowsiness and yawning in a driver.


Raspberry Pi Camera (Rev 1.3): 

        The Raspberry Pi Camera Module Rev 1.3 is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi that allows you to 
        capture images and videos with your Raspberry Pi. It features a 5-megapixel OmniVision OV5647 camera sensor, 
        capable of capturing still images at a resolution of up to 2592x1944 and recording 1080p HD video at 30 
        frames per second. The camera module connects to the Raspberry Pi's CSI (Camera Serial Interface) port, 
        providing a direct and fast connection that enables you to take advantage of the camera's full capabilities. 
        The module is also very small and lightweight, making it easy to integrate into projects that require a 
        small form factor camera. With its high resolution and low cost, the Raspberry Pi Camera Module Rev 1.3 
        is a great tool for a wide range of applications, from home security and surveillance to robotics and 
        scientific imaging.


Buzzer: 
        
        A buzzer is a simple electronic component used to produce sound. In this project, it is used to
        provide audible alerts when drowsiness or yawning is detected.
